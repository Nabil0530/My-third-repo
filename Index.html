        The Most Beautiful Hiking Trails in Eastern PohorjeListen to audio excerpt
        The Slovenes have always had a strong connection with hiking, as they live in a wonderful land, full of both internationally-recognised as well as hidden and undiscovered natural and cultural gems. The entire country is interlaced with kilometres of well-marked hiking trails as well as lots of interesting and educational theme trails. In this article, I’ve decided to present the trails in Eastern Pohorje and its edges that I find the most beautiful.
